<p style="font-weight: normal;">Our chase is so patient and polite! His been a gentle man and a pationate loving dog from 10 weeks old
he LOVEs huges and kisses and is so affectionate. He learns most things in four or five repeatitions. I dont know how they socialise These
pups to be sold exceptional in eight weeks but our dog is clearly the result or good treatment  or generations of great breedings.
His been a blessing and not an ounce of trouble

<p style="font-weight: normal;">I'M SO HAPPY I FOUND "glotelhopethome"... THERE ARE SO MANY BREEDERS THAT DONT CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND 
JUST USE THEIR PUPPIES AS A SOURCE OF INCOME. IT IS HARD TO FIND SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY CARES, AND TAKES THE TIME TO DO THINGS RIGHT.
I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND VISITING THE "HAPPY FACE HOME" AND BE THE NEXT TO DROP IN A COMMEND ABOUT THEM
