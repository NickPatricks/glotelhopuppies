                 <hi style="color: blue ;font-weight:bold">Question : Is shipping really safe for the puppy ?</hi>
                 Answer: shipping a puppy is 100% safe to a new location always sound cruel and embarrasing,   
                 but actually it is not esp with base ustralia airlines. With my many yers of shipping experience, 
                 i know for a fact that all of the puppies  are well taken care of. SO if you stop and think about 
                 it the airlines are not going to mistreat the puppy(s) for fear of lowsuit and customer  dissatifaction.
